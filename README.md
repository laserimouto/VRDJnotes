# Laser Imouto's VRDJ Notes
This is my collection of notes, links and (hopefully) helpful guides I've collected in the course of working on my Virtual Reality DJing (VRDJ) setups.

These notes focus on DJing using Unity or on VRChat, and assumes a workable knowledge of Unity and VR technologies.

If you're brand new to VRDJing, I highly recommend DJ Sharpnel's [NARERU! Virtual DJ (Virtual DJ Startup Guide)](https://booth.pm/ja/items/2766074), available in both English and [Japanese](https://booth.pm/ja/items/1574890). It provides a great introduction to VRDJing, as well as practical guides to go from starting out to actually performing. This book has saved me countless hours, and contains lots of great knowledge from one of the pioneers of VRDJing.
